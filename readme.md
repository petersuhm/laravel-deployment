# Deployment of a Laravel app

At the moment, this repo is just me playing around and trying to figure out how
to deploy Laravel with Python and Fabric. Locally, I'm running Laravel on a
[virtual Ubuntu machine](https://github.com/ShawnMcCool/vagrant-chef), with
[Fabric installed](https://github.com/petersuhm/laravel-deployment/wiki/Installing-Fabric-on-Ubuntu-12.10).

## TODO

* `rollback()` function, to roll back deployments
* Shared folder to store uploads etc.
* Run tests before deploying
